Things to do:
*Remove the code to delete the rhino on punch, since we're dodging it
*Add another enemy
    -Monkey: is punchable so use that code
    -GreyRhino?: faster than average, comes out every couple of seconds
*Do animation(almost  done) 
*Flash screen on lives-- to know you died
*Fix Lives--, ricky dies when hes on a clear level too, fix that.
*Implement a wait period(1 second) after space is pressed to prevent cheating
