Things to do:
*Remove the code to delete the rhino on punch, since we're dodging it
*Add another enemy
    -Monkey: is punchable so use that code
    -GreyRhino?: faster than average, comes out every couple of seconds
    -Duck: comes out if youre on the top platform and the song says "The Quack" ***
        -duck poops causes enemies hit to die. Use rain Function. ++Points?
*Do animation(almost  done) 
    -Get ricky to animate on idle
    -Ricky pucnh & hop on key, Just slow it down
    -Rhino walk animation, make and implement
*Flash screen on lives-- to know you died
*Implement a wait period(1 second) after space is pressed to prevent cheating
*Pause option
*Implement gabe's highscore
*Make use of the UFO(Abduct rhino for help)***
*Cheat code for end of the level
*Display an outback steak house ad in the middle of the screen, enemies that hit it disenigrate. ++Points?
*Move over draw and settiing funtions to separte source files.

Things Fixed :^D :
*Fix Lives--, ricky dies when hes on a clear level too, fix that.
*Show highscore on the game over screen 

*** Signifies powerups
